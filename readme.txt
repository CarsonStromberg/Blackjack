Final Project Overview

- The table that contains the cards of both the dealer and player is generated by javascript, the generation code can be found in the view.js file under the function generateTable()

- The User Inputs are found at the bottom of the page and adjust dynamically as you move through the game to create a dynamic game. The inputs includes a text input bar and multiple buttons with differing functions

- The User input in the form of mouse clicks is implemented on the card images, if you click on the card images a red border will appear around the selected img.

- There are multiple sections on which there is dynamic modification of text using innerHTML, one instances is the notifications that come up at the bottom of the screen notifying the player of the outcome of the round. This code can be found viewWinner() in the view.js file

- The JSON file JSONtemplate.txt is loaded and displays the player's name, in order to change the name, go to JSONtemplate.txt and under the value of the name key, enter the desired name of the player

- The current pot of the table is stored and displayed using the local storage, the setter of the local storage pot is found under the controller.js file and the getter if found under the view.js called getLocalStorage()

- I also added a video tag onto the gamegrid, in the bottom right you will see a how to play button. It will automatically start the video and pause the video automaticlly when you close it. If you click it again you will resume where you left off.
