# Blackjack
HTML, CSS, Javascript Blackjack Project

In order for the program to work properly, it must be run on a local server, I used Web Serve for Chrome to run the application on as there are some get requests to a local so that player's may change their name in the JSONTemplate file.

Steps to get Web Server for Chrome
1. Go to extensions
2. Search for Web Server for Chrome
3. Enable the extension and select the file containing the cloned Blackjack github project
4. On the http://127.0.0.1 as defined by Web Server for Chrome, project should be running
